Experienced in developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game with Java and Swing, implementing the classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, typically "X" and "O". I designed and implemented separate graphical user interfaces for game commands and gameplay interaction, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for players of all skill levels. Utilized Java programming language to implement game logic, including handling player turns, enforcing win conditions, and managing the game board effectively.
